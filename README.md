## Project Overview
This project integrates **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)** analytics to identify and address healthcare disparities in underserved communities.  
Using demographic, geographic, social, and clinical data, interactive dashboards were built to monitor health outcomes, hospital admissions, and chronic disease prevalence in real time.

---

## Business Introduction
**HealthLink Analytics** is a healthcare data solutions provider specializing in integrating clinical and socioeconomic data to improve health outcomes.  
Their mission is to enable stakeholders to allocate resources efficiently, improve preventive care, and reduce hospital readmissions, especially in underserved populations.

---

## Business Problem
HealthLink Analytics faces challenges including:
- Fragmented datasets preventing holistic insights  
- Manual data workflows causing delays and errors  
- Lack of real-time visibility into emerging health issues  
- Limited geospatial insights for resource targeting  
- Collaboration gaps among stakeholders  

**Consequences:** Rising readmissions, poor preventive care, inefficient resource allocation, and low community health equity.

---

## Rationale for the Project
The project addresses healthcare disparities by:
- Promoting equitable resource allocation  
- Automating workflows to reduce errors and delays  
- Enabling data-driven interventions  
- Improving decision-making for policymakers and healthcare providers  
- Enhancing community health outcomes and stakeholder collaboration  

---

## Aim of Project
Develop a centralized, automated **SDOH analytics system** for real-time monitoring of healthcare disparities, empowering stakeholders to take proactive measures, allocate resources efficiently, and improve overall health equity.

---

## Project Objectives
- Integrate fragmented demographic, geographic, social, and health datasets  
- Automate data workflows for faster and reliable insights  
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards with geospatial and trend analysis  
- Monitor key health equity indicators dynamically  
- Foster stakeholder collaboration through shared platforms and automated alerts  

---

## Data Sources
- **Demographic Data:** Age, gender, ethnicity  
- **Geographic Data:** Districts, urban/rural status, transport access, coordinates  
- **Health Indicators:** Hospital admission, preventive care visits, chronic disease rates  
- **Social Factors:** Employment, education, housing stability, health literacy  

---

## Tools Used
- **Excel Online:** Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation, geospatial visualization, trend analysis  
- **Power BI Service:** Automated dashboard refreshes and notifications  
- **Power Automate:** Real-time syncing, stakeholder alerts, and workflow automation  

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Unifying datasets from multiple sources  
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies  
- Creating calculated fields for metrics (admission rates, disease prevalence)  
- Preparing geospatial data for mapping  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Examined population demographics and chronic disease prevalence  
- Visualized hospital admissions by region  
- Analyzed correlation of social determinants with disease outcomes  
- Identified high-risk populations based on income, education, and access to care  

---

## Data Analysis
- Aggregated hospital admissions, preventive care visits, and chronic disease rates  
- Mapped disease prevalence across regions using geospatial visualization  
- Linked social determinants with health outcomes using Power BI metrics  
- Tracked trends over time to identify areas needing intervention  

---

## Results / Findings

### HealthLink Overview
**Healthlink Overview Dashboard:** 
![Healthlink Overview Dashboard]
- Population: **5,005** across 7 regions  
- Chronic disease prevalence highest in **Banjul, Kanifing, Brikama**  
- Health literacy lowest in **Brikama and Kanifing**  
- Income distribution: **38% low, 43% moderate, 19% high**  

### Social Determinants of Health
**Social Determinants of Health dashboard:**
![Social Determinants of Health dashboard]
- Admission Rate: **62.8%**, Readmission Rate: **26.5%**  
- Severe disease prevalence > **75%** across all regions  
- Strong links between low income, low education, lack of preventive care, and high disease prevalence  

### Hospital & Transport Insights
- Poor transport access correlated with higher disease rates  
- Top diseases: **Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Diabetes**  

---

## Recommendations
- Launch health literacy campaigns in **Brikama, Basse, and Kanifing**  
- Deploy mobile clinics in high-risk, low-income regions with poor transport  
- Implement predictive analytics using historical SDOH and admission data  
- Automate digital forms to capture 100% of data and trigger real-time alerts  

---

## Limitations
- Some datasets may have reporting gaps or delayed updates  
- Social determinants data may not capture all contextual factors  
- Geospatial resolution limited to district-level, not household-level  
- Dashboards dependent on continuous data quality and stakeholder engagement
